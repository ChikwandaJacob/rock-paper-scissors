# rock-paper-scissors
In this project i demonstrate my knowledge in JavaScript by using several concepts
to create a game in which a user plays the famous rock, paper, scissors game with the computer.

Simply run the index.html file and press ctrl+shiftI if you are using a web browser like chrome or
firefox to play the game in the console tab.

This version has no user interface.
